To install PyDrive
```
pip install pydrive
```


A more detailed tutorial is available in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@chingjunetao/how-to-manage-files-in-google-drive-with-python-d26471d91ecd) or my [blog](https://chingjunetao.github.io//learning/manage-google-drive-with-python/).

You can read this [article](https://medium.com/@chingjunetao/simple-way-to-access-to-google-service-api-a22f4251bb52) on how to get the JSON file credential of Google Drive API.
